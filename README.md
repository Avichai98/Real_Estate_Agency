My mini project is a real estate office that maintains a list of apartments.
The apartments are divided into 3 categories: apartments for sale, apartments for monthly rent, and apartments for daily rent.
Each apartment has a list of customers who are interested in it.
In addition, there is an option to receive a price for a certain apartment or to receive the maximum apartment price for a certainÂ apartment.
